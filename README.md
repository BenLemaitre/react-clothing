# React Clothing

React Clothing is a typical E-Commerce website built with React, styled-component and Redux for the front-end. "Payments" are handled with Stripe. Data is stored using Firebase.
This project was made to get to learn React and Redux for state management. Therefore the app was not made for any production work but for self-learning purposes only.
